# Door-Indicator
Monitor door indication over Wifi  using two WemosD1 mini and a servo

This is my first real project, so I thought i'll add it to see if it could help anybody new to all this.

I have a shed outside where i can't see the door so I made a door indictor. It works by a Wemos D1 Mini sensing a open/closed 
signal from a magnetic reed switch attached to the door. This is then sent through Wifi through my home router to another 
Wemos D1 Mini which indicates if the door is open or closed by operating a servo with a pointer attached to it.
